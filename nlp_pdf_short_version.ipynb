Received  January 27, 1992 A plyhalogenated acyclic monoterpene, 6(R)-bromo-3(S)-(bromomethyl)-7-methyl-2,3,%trichloro-l-octene (1) was obtained as a major component of the organic extract of  the red alga Portieria homemannu.  X-ray diffraction analysis provided the complete structure, including correct placement of  the different halogen atoms and determination of the absolute stereochemistry.  Detailed NMR analyses provided complete \\'H and assignments.  Compound 1 exhibited highly differential cytotoxicity against the U.S. National Cancer Institute\\'s  new in vitro human tumor cell lime screening panel; brain tumor, renal, and colon tumor cell lines were most sensitive to 1, while leukemia and melanoma lines were relatively leas sensitive. A second collection of P. hmemanni yielded the novel, monocyclic 2, considerably less cytotoxic and devoid of  differential  activity.  On the basis of  its unprecedented  cytotosicity Drofiie in the NCI primary  screen, compound  1 has been selected by the NCI Decision Network Committee for preclinical drug deielopment. Introduction Since the mid-1970s Rhodophyta (red algae) have been known to produce halogenated monoterpenes.\\'  Although scores of  acyclic, monocyclic, and  bicyclic halogenated monoterpenes have  been  identified:  this class of  com- pounds has been confined to the genera Plocamium and Chondrococcw.  The structure elucidation of  these com- pounds has not been a simple task. The relatively volatile monoterpenes tend to decompose under EI-MS conditions and acquisition of  molecular weight  and formula infor- mation has often been  difficult.  Correct placement of chlorine and bromine substituents has not proven to be straightforward, as NMR  chemical shift arguments are clouded by the cumulative effects of  multiple substituents on the Clo skeleton.  We  present here the X-ray crystal structure, absolute stereochemistry, complete lH and 13C NMR  assignments, and  novel  spectrum of  differential cytotoxicity  of  G(R)-brom0-3(S)-(bromomethyl)-7- methyl-2,3,7-trichloro-l-octene (11,  from  the  red  alga Portieria hornemannii. Silva (Chondrococcw hornemannii), which were initially selected for study on the basis of  the finding of  activity in  the  National  Cancer  Institute\\'s  in  vitro  anti-HIV screening were partitioned  between CH2C12 and CH30H-H20 (1:19).  The antiviral CH2C12 solubles were permeated through  Sephadex LH-20.  The  seventh  of seven fractions was crystallized from methanol to give 1, which was inactive in the anti-HIV screen.  Preliminary \\'H  and  13C NMR  analyses  suggested  a  monoterpene. While ELMS failed to provide a discernible molecular ion or M - HX fragment ion, CI-MS did reveal a weak pseu- domolecular ion cluster beginning at m/z 416 (M + %+), which correaponded to the molecular formula C10H1&k2C1,; this  was  confirmed  by  high-resolution  EI-MS.  The structure was  solved by  X-ray  diffraction analysis (see Figure 1). To our knowledge, this is only the third X-ray crystal  structure  of  a  naturally  occurring  halogenated monoterpene.6p6 A compound proposed to have the same structure as 1 was reported  previously by Burreson et al.\\'  as an unre- Br CI 1 Br UCI CCI,h.. ,,.4~ K I2 \\\\a - CI 4 CI 3 Chemistry Organic extracts of P. hornemannii (Lyngbye)  P.

Although compound 1 did not exhibit any HIV-inhibi- tory activity, the anti-HIV activity of  the source extract was further tracked, via bioassay-guided chromatography and dereplication analysis, to traces of  aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin, presumably derived from a cyano- bacterial contaminant or epiphyte in the algal collection.13 Aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin have been previ- ously identified as the anti-HIV constituents of Lyngbya majuscula  in our 1ab0ratory.l~ A second collection of P. hornemannii was made from a different location, Central Visayas, in the Philippines. Analysis of  the organic extracts revealed the absence of 1; instead, a new compound was isolated as the principal monoterpene in this collection.  The structure 2 was as- signed as a result of mass spectral (Cl0HI3Cl3 by HR-EI- 242 nm, c  = 33401,  and NMR analyeea.  The MS), W (A- 13C-NMR spectra disclosed, in addition to the four con- jugated sp2 carbons suggested by the W absorption, two methyls, a quaternary carbon, and three carbons bearing halogens (a methylene and two methines).  The coupling relationships were readily discerned from lH-\\'H  COSY experiments, and the assembly of  the various parts fol- lowed from the HMBC data. The relative stereochemistry was assigned from NOE experiments relationships of H-5 to  H-4 and  H-6, H-4 to H-1, H-8 to H-2; the absolute configuration was not determined. Antitumor Screening Results and Discussion While 1 was inactive in the anti-HIV assay, it appeared quite highly cytotoxic against the uninfected human lym- phoblastoid control cells used in the AIDS-antiviral screen. This observation prompted us to evaluate 1 in the NCI\\'s human tumor, disease-oriented in vitro screen.15-18  In- (13)  butler, J. A; Alvarado, A.  B.; Schaufelberger, D.

For  example, compared  to  some  of  the  less sensitive melanoma and leukemia lines, several of the more sensitive brain, renal, and colon tumor cell lines were as much as 1000-fold or more sensitive to 1 at the GIM re- sponse level and 100-fold at the LCM level. Compound 2 showed little differential cytotoxicity in the NCI screening panel, and it was at least 1 order of mag- nitude lese potent at all three levels of  analysis (GIm, TGI, LCm) than  1 (Figure 2; also see Experimental Section). T w o  related compounds, 3 and 4, from the NCI Repository also  have  been  tested  as part  of  the  NCI\\'s  empirical screening program.  The monocarbocyclic 4 gave a response similar to that of 2, showing some general cytoto.icity, but little differential among the various cell linee; the acyclic \\x0c3010  Journal of  Medicinal Chemistry, 1992,  Vol. 35, No. 16 3  was somewhat more potent than 4  but exhibited only very modest differential activity (data not shown). Other carbocyclic halomonoterpenes from Rhodophyta reportedly have shown general toxicity in brine shrimp and in vitro inhibition of  murine leukemia20 or other21 cell  lines, but  our  results  suggest further  that ceeain human solid tumor cell lines may be particularly smmptible to the cytotoxic effects of some members of this cless of compounds. The contrast between the acyclic and monocyclic compounds would suggest additionally that tbese compounds, particularly the acyclic ones, are not ssting  merely as  electrophiles (alkylating agents); con- sistent with this view were results of  computerized pat- tern-recognition studies, using the COMPARE algorith~ns,~\\'J~ which revealed no resemblance of  the mean graph profiles (not shown) of 1 to known alkylating agents.  Indeed, more extensive COMPARE pattern-recognition analyses likewise revealed  little  or  no  substantial  resemblance  of  the screening profile of  1 to that of any known mechanistic or structural cl.sss of  cytotoxic agent in the entire current (as of March 1,1992) database. Key  features  which  make  the  screening profile  of  1 unique can be appreciated visually in the concentration- response curvcjs (Figure 2).  While a multilog spread in relative celluh sensitivities is not uncommon at the GIw (groarth inhibitory) level of  response, it is uncommon at the most demanding LCW (cytotoxic or net cell killing) Ievd of  rmponse.  Moreover, the clustering of the relatively more sensitive lines among the renal, brain, colon, and non-snall-cell  lung  cancer  subpanels,  along  with  the clustering of the relatively less sensitive lines among the leukemia and  melanoma  subpanels  (see Experimental Section), is a highly unusual combination.  A selection of those tumor cell lines showing the highest in vitro sensi- tivity to 1 will provide appropriate targets for detailed in vivo therapeutic investigations in appropriate xenograft models. Further biological activity comparisons of  1 with com- pounds not yet tested in the NCI screen but reported in the literature to have antitumor or cytotoxic properties in other screening systems are problematic at the present time.  Consistent or standardized reporting standards or formats for compounds tested in the new NCI screen need to be adopted by investigators more generally to facilitate such comparisons in  the future.  Herein, we  offer  two emmples of  complementary approaches to reporting com- parative biological data derived from the new NCI in vitro primary screen. Figure 2 exemplifies a composite which can be prepared directly from the laser-print graphical information typically included  in  the  standard  NCI  screening  data  report package provided to all submitters of  compounds to the NCI program.  Extraneous, repetitive, or otherwise dis- tmcting information has been removed and the graphical srsling simplified to allow considerable photoreduction yet still vividly  illustrate  the contrasting concentration-re- sgonse profiles. While the reporting of  screening results in simplified graphical formats may be very useful to illustrate, rein- (19)  Konig,  G.  M.;  Wright,  A.  D.;  Sticher,  0.

Fuller  et al. force, contrast, or compare certain unique, rare, or oth- erwise highly unusual  screening profiles such as those presented herein, we  do not suggest that such graphical reporting  necessarily  should  be  adopted  routinely  for publication. Just as NMR, mass spectrometric, and other routine, documentary spectral data are reported typically in  the chemical literature  in  a  cryptic, alphanumerical rather than graphical format, a similar approach may be more  efficient, and more acceptable to editors, for the routine  reporting  of  data  from  the  new  NCI  primary screen.  An example of  such an approach to an alphanu- merical format is given for compound 1 and 2 in the Ex- perimental Section.  The information provided is sufficient to allow the reader to reconstruct a \"mean graph\" profile which, in turn, could be used for comparisons, either vis- ually  or  by  computer, with  similarly reconstructed  or otherwise reported screening profiles of  known standards or other compounds of  interest in the future. In summary, we describe here the discovery of  a natu- rally-occurring pentahalogenated  monoterpene  which produces a highly novel cytotoxicity profile against the diverse tumor types which comprise the NCI\\'s  primary screening panel.  We have presented the biological activity information in a variety of formats both to illustrate the unusual spectrum of  activity of  this particular compound and to offer some complementary data-reporting alterna- tives that hopefully may contribute to the evolution of consistent reporting standards for investigators using the new NCI screen. Compound 1 produces one of the most extreme exam- ples of  differential cytotoxicity observed thus far in the first 2 years of  operation of  the NCI screen.  The com- pound clearly is not a general cell poison; its preferential cytotoxicity to cell lines derived from highly chemoresis- tant  human  tumors  is  intriguing.  The  NCI  Decision Network Committee recently reached a similar consensus and selected compound  1 for drug development.22  An immediate NCI priority is mass recollection (now ongoing) of  P. homemannii from the original collection site, as well as the investigation of chemical synthesis as an alternate source of  the compound for preclinical development. Experimental Section Collection, Extraction, and Fractionation of P. Borne- mannii.  Our original sample of P. hornemannii was collected by  Ernani  G.  Menez  near  Chanaryan,  Batan  Island,  in  the Philippines in April 1986.  A voucher specimen is on deposit at the Smithsonian Institution.  The alga waa  frozen on collection, lyophilized, and extracted with CH2C12-MeOH (l:l), followed by a MeOH rinse.  The crude organic extract (2.5 g)  waa partitioned between CH2Cll (100 mL) and H2CkMeOH (191,100 mL). \"he dichloromethane phase was reduced, in vacuo, and permeated through Sephadex LH-20 (column 2.5 X  150 cm) with CH2C12- MeOH  (1:l).  Seven fractions were obtained. 6 ( R  )-Bromo-J(S )-(bromomethyl)-7-methyl-2,3,7-tri- chloro-l-octene (1).

Preliminary X-ray photographs displayed orthorhombic symmetry. Accurate lattice constants of a = 6.115 (4) i$ b = 12.456 (6) A,  c = 19.188 (10) A were determined from 30 diffractometer measured 28 values.  Systematic extinctions, optical activity, and crystal density were consistent with space group P212121, with one molecule of  composition C1a1,@r2C13 forming the asymmetric unit.  Additional crystallographic parameters were  V = 1461.6 (14) A3, p(Mo Ka) 6.02  mm-\\',  and D, = 1.824 g cm-3 for 2 = 4. Intensity data were  collected  on  a  Nicolet (Siemens) P21 dif- fradometer with Mo Ka radiation (0.71073 A) and a 28-8 scan technique.  A total of  1157 Friedel unique data were collected, of which 686 (59%) with IF,I  1 4@,I  were considered observed after correction for Lorentz, polarization, and background effects. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix, least-squares techniques.=  The final refinements with anisotropic thermal parameters for all nonhydmgen atoms, riding isotropic hydrogens, and anomalous scattering corrections for bromine and chlorine converged smoothly to a final discrepancy index of  7.81%  for the enantiomer shown  (WR = 6.72%).  The other enantiomer converged to the significantly higher value of 8.51%.  The absolute configuration also was ascertained by the 9-test.

The subsequent collection of P. hornemunnii (2.7 kg fresh weight) was made at Banilad, Bacong, Central V i y a s ,  in the Philippines in April 1991, and kept frozen for transport and storage prior to extraction.  The frozen alga was ground with dry ice in a ham- burger grinder and extracted sequentially with MeOH-CH2C12 (3:1, then 2 X  1:l). The extracts were filtered  and evaporated at 22  OC  to an aqueous suspension, which was extracted with CH2C12. The CHzC12 extracts were evaporated, again at 22  OC, to give 10.39 g of  a dark green oil.  A portion (1.7 g) of this extract was partitioned between CH30H-H20  (19:l) and hexane.  The hexane-soluble fraction (1.074 g) was permeated through Sephadex LH-20 (2.5 X  150 cm) with CH2C12-MeOH (1:l) to give seven fractions;  the  seventh  fraction  was  essentially  pure  1-[3-(1- chloro-2(E)-propenyl)]-2,4-dichloro-3,3-diethylcyclohex-5-ene (2):  116 mg of  colorless oil; [a] +71.3O  (c 1.0, CHC13); UV & (CH2C12) 242 nm (c  = 3340); HR-ELMS m / z  240.0055 (calcd for CloH1336C1~7C1, 240.0053),  238.0072  (calcd  for  C10H1336C13, 238.0083); LR-EM-MS m / z  (relative intensity) 2401238 (M\\', 9/10), 205 (14), 203 (201,189 (61,187 (8), 169 (33), 167 (loo), 153 (19), 133 (26), 131 (32), 117 (36), 115 (35).

Two new macrolides, mycalolides D 111 and E 121, were isolated and identified, in addition to the known compound  mycalolide C [31. The macrolide structures were elucidated  by  detailed analysis of their spectroscopic data and by comparison with related compounds. Stony  (scleractinian)  corals  in  the genus Tubastreu (Dendrophylliidae) have been reported  to be  a source of biologi- cally  active  alkaloids  (1,2),  including aplysinopsin (3) and related brominated indole  derivatives (4,5). They  have  not previously  been  known  to  contain macrolide metabolites.  An  extract from an  Australian  collection  of  Tubastreu faulkneri Wells was found to be cytotoxic in  the  60-cell-line  antitumor  screen of the  NCI  (6,7).  Bioassay-directed  frac- tionation of the extract provided an inac- tive fraction which contained aplysinop- sin-type alkaloids and  a cytotoxic frac- tion rich in polyoxazole macrolides. De- scribed herein is the isolation, structure elucidation,  and  cytotoxicity  profile  of two new macrolides, mycalolides D 117 and  E  121,  along  with  the  known mycalolide C 137, from this collection of Tubastreu faulkneri. An  organic  extract  (2.2  g)  of  T. faulkneri, from the Great Barrier Reef of Australia,  was  subjected  to  a  solvent- solvent partitioning protocol (8) that con- centrated the cytotoxic activity into CC1,- and CHC1,-soluble fractions. The CC1,- soluble fraction was further separated by gel  permeation  cc  on  Sephadex LH-20 and  diol  bonded-phase  hplc  to  give mycalolides C 133 (14 mg) and D 111 (6 mg). The CHC1,  partition  fraction was chromatographed on diol packing by vlc. Several of the early-eluting  vlc fractions were  subjected  to  diol hplc  to give  in- dole-3-carboxaldehyde (1 mg) (9,10), 6- bromoindole-3-carboxaldehyde  (2  mg) (10,11), and  a  mixture  of  macrolides. Purification of this macrolide mixture by C,, hplc gave mycalolide E 127 (1 mg) and an  additional  5  mg of  3. The very  late eluting material from the diol vlc column was  subjected  to  C,,  hplc  to afford  the 1 \\x0cJuly  19957 Rashid et a / . :   Cytotoxic Macrolides from Tubastreu 1121 \" i  I yellow  pigment  3\\'-deamino-2\\',4\\'- bis(demethyl)-3 \\'-oxoaplysinopsin {47 (3 mg) (4) as a 4: 1 mixture of ZIE geometri- cal isomers and a similar 4: 1 ZIE isomeric mixture of the 6-bromo analogue {\\'I (3 mg) (4). All of the indole derivatives were identified by  comparison of their physi- cal and spectral characteristics with those described in the literature. The molecular formula of compound 3, obtained as a colorless gum, was estab- lished  by  high-resolution  fabms  as C51H72N4016. The \\'H- and 13C-nmr data 4  R=H 5  R=Br that we recorded were virtually identical to spectral data reported for mycalolide C 133, isolated  previously  from  a  sponge (12). The molecular formula of mycalolide D El7 was established as C5,H,,N40,,  by fabms and had uv (A  max 228 and 260 nm) and  ir  (v max  3380,  1748,  1734, 1700,1652 cm-\\')  absorptions appropri- ate for an oxazole-containing macrolide. The \\'H- and 13C-nmr spectra of 1 (Table 1) showed close correspondence to those reported for mycalolide C 137. Restricted rotation around the C-N bond of the N- methyl  formamide  resulted  in  doubled \\'H-  and  13C-nmr signals,  in  a  ratio  of approximately 2: 1, for those groups close to  the  unsaturated  formamide  moiety. This spectral feature, previously observed for the mycalolides (1 2), ulapualides (1 3), kabiramides  (14,15),  halichondramides (16,17), and jaspisamides (18), is charac- teristic of this class of macrolide.

The C-5-C-6  and  C- 1 9 4 - 2 0  double bonds could be assigned as E  based on the large vicinal couplings ( J =  15.6 and 16.1 Hz, respectively) ob- served between the olefinic protons. The substitution of methoxy groups at C-22 and  C-26  and  an  acetate  at  C-32  was confirmed by  HMBC  correlations.  The principal differences between the spectra of  1 and  3 were variations  in the C-30 acyl groups and in the C - 8 4 - 1 2  region. Although  compound  3 is characterized by  a  2-O-methyllactate  group  at  C-30, compound  1 showed  \\'H-  {methyl  sin- gletsat63.37and3.46; 1Hmultipletsat 6 3.60, 3.62, and 3.901 and  13C-nmr E6 170.4,80.7,73.1,59.4,58.7]resonances appropriate  for  a  2,3-di-O-methylgly- cerate  substituent.  COSY  correlations supported this assignment and an HMBC correlation from the C-30 methine pro- ton (6 5.09) to C-36 (6 170.4) confirmed its  substitution  at  C-30.  Compound  1 revealed  two  \\'H-nmr  singlets  (6 8.10, 8.33) and  six 13C-nmr signals (6 130.1, 136.6, 138.6, 143.2, 155.3,  162.7) in- dicative  of  two  adjacent  disubstituted oxazoles.  HMBC  correlations  required that one oxazole was conjugated to C-19, while the proton (6 8.33) of the second oxazole showed a three-bond correlation to  the  adjacent  C-12  (6  157.8) imide carbonyl group. The imide N H  (6 10.19) correlated with both the C-10 (6 173.5) and C-12 imide carbonyls, while correla- tions  from  the  C-9  methine  proton  (6 3.05) and one of the C-8 methylene pro- tons (6 2 -67) to C- 10 confirmed the place- ment of the imide group. The presence of three contiguous oxazole rings is typical \\'For  convenience of comparison,  C-1 1 in  1 was  intentionally  omitted  in  the  numbering scheme, as has been done for the imide derivative of halichondramide (16). of  this  class of  macrolide; however,  re- placement of the C- 10-C- 1 2  oxazole with an imide in mycalolide D 117 is reminis- cent of a Halichondria macrolide, which had an imide in place of the C- 16-C- 18 oxazole (16). Substitution  of  a  methyl group at C-9, similar to the ulapualides (1 3), was confirmed by an HMBC corre- lation from the methyl protons to C-10. Thus, we were able to assign structure 1 to mycalolide D. Mycalolide E 127, isolated as a minor constituent,  displayed  uv,  ir,  and  \\'H- nmr spectra similar to those of mycalolide C  131.  The  hrfabms  revealed  a  MH\\' pseudomolecular  ion  at  mlz  879.4434, which established the molecular formula as C46H62N1013. The structure Of  2 Was deduced primarily from \\'H-nmr  studies and comparison of its spectral data with those of 3 and other related compounds in the literature. By COSY analysis and spectral comparison, the C-1 through C- 8 portion of 2 was shown to be identical to that of 3. However, the C-9 methoxy substituent of 3 was replaced by a methyl group (6 1.3 1) in 2. Irradiation of the C- 9 methyl signal induced strong nOe in- teractions  with  the C-8 methyl  and  H- 11. Mycalolide E  127  is  the  first  com- pound  in this class to have methyl sub- stituents  at  both  C-8  and  C-9.  Three singlet aromatic  resonances characteris- tic  of  a  trisoxazole  constellation  were observed in 2. Again, the C-19-C-29 por- tion  of  2 was  shown by  direct  spectral comparison and COSY and nOe results to be identical to the corresponding regions in compounds 1 and 3. The lack of an acyl group  and  methine  proton  at  C-30, coupled with  deshielded signals for the C-29 methylene protons (6 2.48,2H, m) and theC-31 methineproton(62.75,m) indicated  a ketone at C-30. A C-30 ke- tone has been  observed in a majority  of the trisoxazole macrolides (1 2-1  8). Com- parative  analysis  indicated  that  C-3 1 through  the  terminal  N-methyl  for- mamide group of 2 was clearly related to  that  section of  compounds  1 and  3, \\x0c1124 Journal of Natural Products mol. 58, No. 7 with the exception of C-33. In 2, C-33 is an allylic methylene, while C-33 in both 1 and  3  is  substituted  with  a  methyl group. The C-33 protons (8 2.46,2H, m) showed nOe interactions with H-35 and vicinal  couplings  to  the  C-32  methine proton and the C-34 olefinic proton. The spectral data we recorded for compound 2 were  in  good  agreement  with  data  re- ported  for  C-33-demethylhalichondra- mides (1 6) and jaspisamides (18). While the structure ofmycalolide E 127 has been deduced  by  spectral analyses, confirma- tion using  heteronuclear correlation ex- periments  was  not  possible  due  to  the limited supply of the compound. Mycalolides C  13) and  D  111 were screened  against  the  NCI\\'s  60-human- tumor cell line panel. They showed mod- est general cytotoxicity with average LC,, values of  2.5  p M  and  0.6  pM, respec- tively. They did not produce a pattern or a  degree  of  differential  cytotoxicity  of sufficient interest to encourage any fur- ther  study.  Mycalolide  E  E27 was  not tested due to insufficient material. Prior to this investigation, macrocy- clic lactones containing two or three con- tiguous oxazole rings have only been iso- lated  from  nudibranchs  and  their  egg masses (13-16),  and from sponges of the genera Halicbondria (1 6,17), Jaspis  (1 8), and Mycule( 12). Therefore, it was surpris- ing to find this class of  compound  in a coelenterate extract. Examination ofpho- tographs of the original T. faulkneri col- lection  and  voucher  specimens did  not reveal any obvious nudibranch or sponge tissue. Thus, it appears thedistributionof polyoxazole macrolides can be expanded to include corals in the genus Tubastrea. EXPERIMENTAL GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.-h- stnunentation  and standard procedures have been described elsewhere (1 9,20). ANIMAL m T E w . S a m p l e s   of  Tubastm fuulkkneri Wells were  collected along Salamander Reef at  Cape Cleveland, the  Great  Barrier Reef, northeast  Australia,  by  Dr.  Peter  Murphy  and colleagues of  the  Australian  Institute  of  Marine Science (AIMS). Voucher specimens (Q66C1269) from  this  collection  are  maintained  at  the Queensland Museum in Brisbane. EXTRACTION AND munoN.-Fmh samples were  frozen after collection and  stored  at  -20\\' until they were processed. Frozen samples (614 g) were  mixed  with  dry  ice,  ground  to  a  coarse powder, and then extracted with H,O.  The marc was  refrozen,  lyophilized,  and  sequentially  ex- tracted  with  MeOH-CH2C12 (1:l)  and  100% MeOH. The combined organic extracts were evapo- rated at reduced pressure togive 2.84g ofa brown tar. The total extract was  separated by a liquid- liquid  partitioning  protocol  (8) which  concen- trated the antitumor activity into CCI, and CHCI, fractions. The CCI,-soluble material (247 mg) was fractionated  by  gel  permeation  cc  on  Sephadex LH-20  eluting  with  hexane-CH,CI,-MeOH (2:5:1). Anearlyeluting LH-20 fraction(l30mg) retained the antitumor activity. This fraction was furtherpurified byhplconawide-porediolbonded- phase  column  (YMC,  1 x 2 0  cm,  300  A)  with hexane-CH2C1,-MeOH  (1 5:49: 1)  to  give mycalolides C [3] (14 mg) and D 11) (6 mg). The CHCI,-soluble  fraction  from  the  initial  liquid partitioning step was subjected to diol (YMC) vlc with a step-gradient elution. The cytotoxic mate- rial eluted with  100% CH,CI,  through  CH,CI,- MeOH  (97:3) was  separated by  diol  hplc  with hexane-CH2CI2-MeOH (15:49: 1) to yield indole- 3-carboxaldehyde  (1  mg),  6-bromoindole-3- carboxaldehyde(2 mg),andamixtureofmacrolides that  were ultimately  purified by  C,,  hplc (1x25 cm  column),  using  MeOH-H,O  (4:l) to  afford mycalolide E C2] (1 mg) and an additional 5 mg of 3.

The structure of this compound was determined to be3-O-[(cid:226)-D-glucopyranosyl(1f2)]-[R-D-arabinopyranosyl(1f3)],[R-l-arabinofuranosyl(1f4)-(cid:226)-D-glucuronopy-ranosyl-21-angeloyl-22-senecioylolean-12-en-3(cid:226),15R,16R,21(cid:226),22R,28-hexol by spectral, chemical, and GCanalyses. This compound showed weak cytotoxicity against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line.176.7, 169.5, 168.3, 159.1, 143.6, 138.4, 129.5, 127.0, and116.7. The chemical shifts of the carbonyl signals and theabsorption band at 1720 cm-1 in the IR spectrum indicatedthe presence of two R,(cid:226)-unsaturated ester functionalities.This interpretation was supported by an absorption maxi-mum at 214 nm in the UV spectrum. In addition, thepresence of a carboxylic acid functionality was indicatedby a carbon signal at (cid:228) 176.7 in the 13C NMR spectrumand an absorption maximum at 1720 cm-1 in the IRspectrum. The negative FABMS of 1 exhibited a quasimo-lecular ion peak at m/z 1271 [M-H]-. Other significantfragmentation peaks visible at m/z 1139 [(M - H) - 132]-and 1109 [(M - H)+ - 162]- corresponded to the loss ofone terminal hexose and one terminal pentose unit, re-spectively.In recent years we have been engaged in a program todiscover bioactive compounds using a mechanism-basedbioassay involving genetically engineered mutants of theyeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae2 along with cytotoxicityagainst the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line.3 As apart of our continuing search for potential anticanceragents, a sample of Pittosporum viridiflorum Sims (Pittospo-raceae) collected in Madagascar as part of the plantcollection program of the National Cancer Institute wassubjected to testing, and its methanol extract was foundto exhibit weak cytotoxicity to the A2780 human ovariancancer cell line as well as activity in the yeast assay.A number of investigators have examined extracts of theleaves of Pittosporum species, including P. viridiflorum, fortheir antimicrobial effects;4,5 this is apparently due to anumber of volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes.6-8 Mollus-cicidal activity was also described.9 A number of saponinaglycons isolated from P. viridiflorum have also beenreported.10 Herein we report the structure and bioactivityof a novel triterpenoid saponin, designated as pittovirido-side (1).The MeOH extract of P. viridiflorum was subjected tosolvent partitioning followed by C18 vacuum flash chroma-tography of the bioactive aqueous MeOH fraction, with thefractionation being guided by the results of A2780 cyto-toxicity and yeast assays. The chromatographic fractioneluted from the C18 column with 70% and 80% aqueousMeOH was bioactive (IC12 120, 150, 150, 140 (cid:237)g/mL againstthe 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7 yeast strains) and waspurified by repeated reversed-phase HPLC and Si gelpreparative TLC to give the new saponin pittoviridoside(1).Compound 1 was obtained as an amorphous whitepowder that was determined to have the compositionC62H96O27 by HRFABMS and 13C NMR analyses. The IRspectrum showed absorptions at 3400 (OH) and 1720(CdO of COOH and R(cid:226)-unsaturated ester) cm-1. The 13CNMR spectra of this compound showed signals character-istic of three carbonyl groups and three double bonds at (cid:228)* To whom inquiries should be addressed. Tel: (540) 231-6570.

A molecular formulaof C40H62O8 was deduced for 2 by a combination of HR-FABMS and 13C NMR spectrometry. The presence of sixcarbon signals ((cid:228) 78.9, 78.0, 73.0, 72.5, 67.6, and 62.8) inthe 13C NMR spectrum indicated this compound to containa number of oxygen-based functionalities. This interpreta-10.1021/np010327t CCC: $22.00© 2002 American Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosyPublished on Web 12/21/2001\\x0c66 Journal of Natural Products, 2002, Vol. 65, No. 1Notestion was supported by the 1H NMR spectrum, in whichseven downfield signals were observed at (cid:228) 6.65 (1H, d, J) 10.2 Hz), 6.25 (1H, d, J ) 10.2 Hz), 4.35 (1H, dd, J )4.2, 4.2 Hz), 4.20 (1H, dd, J ) 9.4, 4.2 Hz), 3.73 (1H, dd, J) 9.8, 4.6 Hz), 3.48 (1H, m), and 3.43 (1H, dd, J ) 9.8, 4.6Hz). Two of the seven oxygenated proton signals at (cid:228) 3.73and 3.43 were confirmed to be due to oxymethylene protonsby DEPT and HMQC experiments. In addition, a carefulexamination of the 1H and 13C NMR and IR spectrarevealed that another two oxygenated protons ((cid:228) 6.65 and6.25) were present as esters of angelic and senecic acids.The overall structure of 2 was determined by a combina-tion of 1H COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC experimentsand by comparison of NMR spectral data with literaturedata.11 The relative positions of the angeloyl and senecioylgroups were confirmed by long-range correlations of H-21and H-22 with quaternary carbonyl carbons; H-21 cor-¢ of the angeloyl group at (cid:228) 169.0 and H-22related with C-1¢with C-1¢ of the senecioyl group at (cid:228) 166.7, respectively.Thus, the structure of pittoviridagenin was unambiguous-ly determined as 21-angeloyl-22-senecioylolean-12-en-3(cid:226),15R,16R,21(cid:226),22R,28-hexol, or 21-angeloyl-22-senecioyl-R1-barrigenol (2).In the 1H NMR spectrum of pittoviridoside (1), signalsfor four anomeric protons at (cid:228) 5.18 (1H, br s), 5.00 (1H, d,J ) 7.8 Hz), 4.91 (1H, d, J ) 7.4 Hz), and 4.46 (1H, d, J )7.8 Hz) were correlated with signals for four carbons at (cid:228)108.2, 102.9, 104.1, and 105.7 by an HMQC experimentand were diagnostic for the presence of four sugar residues.The chemical shift of C-3 at (cid:228) 91.9 indicated that the foursugars were attached to C-3 of the aglycon. The identifica-tion of each sugar unit as well as their linkages wasestablished by chemical degradation, TLC and GC analy-ses, and extensive NMR experiments.Acid hydrolysis of 1 followed by TLC analysis of thehydrolysate and direct comparison with standard sugarsindicated the presence of glucose, arabinose, and glucuronicacid, and these results were confirmed by GC-MS analysisof the methyl acetates and comparison to standards. Theabsolute configurations of the hydrolyzed pentoses weredetermined by GC-MS analysis of their thiazolidinederivatives prepared with l-cysteine methyl ester hydro-chloridefollowed by peracetylation, as previouslyreported.2g,12, H-3¢, C-3¢, and C-4¢Most of the protons and carbons of each sugar unit wereassigned on the basis of extensive NMR 1H-1H COSY,TOCSY, and HMQC experiments. The assignment of thesignals of C-2¢in the glucuronic acidmoiety was difficult because the signals of H-2¢, andH-4¢¢ were overlapped almost completely in the 1H NMRthese signals were thus assigned by anspectrum;HMQC-COSY experiment. The cyclic structures of themonosaccharides were also determined to be D-glucu-ronopyranose, D-glucopyranose, L-arabinopyranose, andD-arabinofuranose (or alternatively D-arabinopyranose andL-arabinofuranose) by 1D TOCSY and HMBC data. Acombination of the HMBC and 1D and 2D NOESY experi-ments and mass spectral data of sugar derivatives estab-lished the arrangement of these sugar residues. A long-¢ with C-3 revealed a linkagerange correlation of H-1¢between C-1¢¢ of the glucuronic acid and C-3 of the aglycon.This interpretation was confirmed by a strong NOESYcross-peak between H-3 and H-1¢¢ and also between H-23and H-1¢. Similarly, a long-range correlation between¢ assigned the linkage between glucuronicH-1¢acid and glucose with the additional confirmation ofNOESY correlations between H-24 and protons of H-5¢and C-2¢) with C-3¢and H-6¢. The linkage between the glucuronic acid andthe arabinopyranose was defined by an HMBC correlationof the anomeric proton of the arabinopyranose at (cid:228) 4.91(H-1¢of the glucuronic acid at (cid:228) 80.2. Thelinkage between the arabinofuranose and the glucuronicacid was assigned by an HMBC correlation between theanomeric proton of the arabinofuranose at (cid:228) 5.18 (H-1¢)and C-4¢¢ at (cid:228) 75.1.Further evidence for the nature of the sugar linkageswas derived from analysis of the MS fragmentation of thesugars after methylation, reduction, hydrolysis, reduction,acetylation, and GC separation (Scheme 1, SupportingInformation).13 The monosaccharides D-glucuronopyranose,D-glucopyranose, and D-arabinopyranose were confirmed tohave (cid:226)-, (cid:226)-, and R-linkages respectively by measurementof the coupling constants of their anomeric protons, whilethe R-configuration of L-arabinofuranose was clarified byobservation of NOESY correlations between the C-1, C-3,and C-5 protons of this sugar.¢ and H-1¢The remaining problem was to distinguish between thetwo possibilities of L-arabinopyranose/D-arabinofuranoseand D-arabinopyranose/L-arabinofurnaose for the arabinoseunits; this assignment was made by interpretation ofNOESY data. Correlations between H-3¢andbetween H-4¢and H-1¢could be assigned unambigu-ously since the attachment point of each sugar wasestablished by HMBC experiments and other key protonsof arabinoses were not involved in the region around (cid:228) 3.86,where H-3¢of glucuronic acid were almostcompletely overlapped. A strong NOE was also observedbetween H-2¢of thearabinofuranose. Therefore, the absolute configurations ofarabinopyranose and arabinofuranose must be defined asD and L, respectively. If these configurations were ex-changed, a NOESY cross peak would not have been foundof arabinopyranose and H-4¢between H-2¢of arabino-furanose.of the arabinopyranose and H-4¢and H-4¢The structure of pittoviridoside (1) was thus identifiedunequivocally as 3-O-[(cid:226)-D-glucopyranosyl(1f2)]-[R-D-ara-binopyranosyl(1f3)]-[R-L-arabinofuranosyl(1f4)-(cid:226)-D-glu-curonopyranosyl-21-angeloyl-22-senecioyl-R1-barrigenol. Al-though several saponins containing R1-barrigenol andglucuronic acid have been isolated from various phy-tochemical sources,9,14 1 has two unusual structural fea-tures compared with previous isolates. In the first place,it has both D-arabinopyranose and L-arabinofuranose in thesugar portion of the molecule. The coexistence of ara-binopyranose and arabinofuranose with the same absoluteconfiguration has been reported only rarely,15 althoughdifferent compounds isolated from the same plant havingarabinose units with the opposite absolute configurationshave also been reported.16 To the best of our knowledge,however, this is the first example of a nonpolymericcompound simultaneously having the same sugar unit withopposite absolute stereochemistries and different ring sizes.A second unusual feature is the presence of a consecutively1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted glycosidic linkage in the glucuronicacid part. This kind of functionality appears to have beenreported only once previously.15bPittoviridoside 1 showed weak activity (IC12 85, 80, 140,and 100 (cid:237)g/mL) against the 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7strains in our yeast bioassay; IC12 is the concentrationrequired to inhibit the growth of a microorganism in a 12mm diameter zone.

The plant was collected in April 1993 bystaff from the Missouri Botanical Garden in AntsirananaProvince in the Ankarana Reserve of Madagascar. Pittosporumviridiflorum is an undergrowth tree, and the sample was froma branch. The collection number was NCI # Q66V2626, MBG# 1726; the sample used was one of four parts of the plantthat were collected. The plant was identified by Roy Gereauat Missouri Botanical Garden.Yeast Bioassay. The Sc-72a and 1138/1140/13532c yeastbioassays were carried out as previously described.Cytotoxicity Bioassay. The A2780 cytotoxicity assay wasperformed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Uni-versity as previously reported.3Extraction and Isolation. The plant samples were dried,ground, and extracted with MeOH to give the dried methanolicextract N056221. The bioactive MeOH extract (2.71 g) de-scribed was active against the mutant 1138, 1140, 1353, andSc7. The MeOH extract (IC12 650, 700, 800, 1150 (cid:237)g/mL inthe 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7 yeast strains) was dissolved in80% aqueous MeOH (250 mL) and extracted with n-hexane(300 mL (cid:2) 2). The bioactive aqueous MeOH layer was dilutedwith H2O to 60% aqueous MeOH and then partitioned withCH2Cl2 (300 mL (cid:2) 2).

The sugar compo-nents of the aqueous layer left after hydrolysis were analyzedby Si gel TLC, the solvent system used being CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (32:18:4, v/v). Spots were visualized by spraying with 95%EtOH-H2SO4-anisaldehyde (9:0.5:0.5, v/v) and heating at 120°C for 10 min. The results were confirmed by GC-MS analysisof methyl sugar peracetates. The aqueous layer was evapo-rated, dissolved in 10% HCl-dry MeOH (2 mL), and heatedunder reflux for 4 h. After removing the solvent under reducedpressure, the residue was treated with excess acetic anhydrideand pyridine. Removal of the solvent by blowing with nitrogengave the methyl sugar peracetates, which were analyzed byGC-MS and compared with authentic methyl sugar acetatestandards. The GC-MS runs were performed using a 30 m (cid:2)0.32 mm i.d. HP-5 column with an initial temperature of 75°C for 1 min and then temperature programming to 250 °C ata rate of 10 °C/min.Linkage Analysis. The analysis was carried out as previ-ously described.2gStereochemical Determination of Pentoses. The de-termination of the absolute configuration of the pentoses wasperformed by Hara’s method12 as previously described.2gPittoviridoside (1 mg) was placed in 0.25 mL of MeOH and0.5 mL of 1 N HCl. This was heated at 100 °C overnight. Waterand CHCl3 were added, the mixture was shaken, and thewater-soluble fraction was dried by rotary evaporation. Thisfraction was placed in 0.3 mL of pyridine, and 3 mg of cysteinemethyl ester hydrochloride was added; this was heated for 2h at 100 °C. Acetic anhydride (0.3 mL) was then added andallowed to react for a further 2 h. The sample was cooled andsolvent removed by blowing off with argon to yield a mixtureof thiazolidine-carboxylate derivatives, which was analyzed byGC-MS using a 30 m (cid:2) 0.32 mm i.d. HP-5 capillary columnconnected to the VG7070EHF mass spectrometer. The injectortemperature was 200 °C, and a temperature of 75 °C for 1 minand then a gradient to 250 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min wasused. Individual peaks for the thiazolidine derivatives ofL-arabinose (26.24 min) and D-arabinose (24.41 min) wereobserved.Acknowledgment.
