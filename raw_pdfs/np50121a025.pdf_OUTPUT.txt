ABSTRACT.-Fractionation 

of  a  cytotoxic  extract  of  the  stony  coral  Tubastru faulkneri 
yielded a series of cytotoxic polyoxazole macrolides and several noncytotoxic indole derivatives. 
Two new macrolides, mycalolides D 111 and E 121, were isolated and identified, in addition to 
the known compound  mycalolide C [31. The macrolide structures were elucidated  by  detailed 
analysis of their spectroscopic data and by comparison with related compounds. 

Stony  (scleractinian)  corals  in  the 
genus Tubastreu (Dendrophylliidae) have 
been reported  to be  a source of biologi- 
cally  active  alkaloids  (1,2),  including 
aplysinopsin (3) and related brominated 
indole  derivatives (4,5). They  have  not 
previously  been  known  to  contain 
macrolide metabolites.  An  extract from 
an  Australian  collection  of  Tubastreu 
faulkneri Wells was found to be cytotoxic 
in  the  60-cell-line  antitumor  screen of 
the  NCI  (6,7).  Bioassay-directed  frac- 
tionation of the extract provided an inac- 
tive fraction which contained aplysinop- 
sin-type alkaloids and  a cytotoxic frac- 
tion rich in polyoxazole macrolides. De- 
scribed herein is the isolation, structure 
elucidation,  and  cytotoxicity  profile  of 
two new macrolides, mycalolides D 117 
and  E  121,  along  with  the  known 
mycalolide C 137, from this collection of 
Tubastreu faulkneri. 

An  organic  extract  (2.2  g)  of  T. 
faulkneri, from the Great Barrier Reef of 
Australia,  was  subjected  to  a  solvent- 
solvent partitioning protocol (8) that con- 
centrated the cytotoxic activity into CC1,- 
and CHC1,-soluble fractions. The CC1,- 
soluble fraction was further separated by 
gel  permeation  cc  on  Sephadex LH-20 
and  diol  bonded-phase  hplc  to  give 
mycalolides C 133 (14 mg) and D 111 (6 
mg). The CHC1,  partition  fraction was 
chromatographed on diol packing by vlc. 
Several of the early-eluting  vlc fractions 
were  subjected  to  diol hplc  to give  in- 
dole-3-carboxaldehyde (1 mg) (9,10), 6- 
bromoindole-3-carboxaldehyde  (2  mg) 
(10,11), and  a  mixture  of  macrolides. 
Purification of this macrolide mixture by 
C,, hplc gave mycalolide E 127 (1 mg) and 
an  additional  5  mg of  3. The very  late 
eluting material from the diol vlc column 
was  subjected  to  C,,  hplc  to afford  the

yellow  pigment  3'-deamino-2',4'- 
bis(demethyl)-3 '-oxoaplysinopsin {47 (3 
mg) (4) as a 4: 1 mixture of ZIE geometri- 
cal isomers and a similar 4: 1 ZIE isomeric 
mixture of the 6-bromo analogue {'I 
(3 
mg) (4). All of the indole derivatives were 
identified by  comparison of their physi- 
cal and spectral characteristics with those 
described in the literature. 

The molecular formula of compound 
3, obtained as a colorless gum, was estab- 
lished  by  high-resolution  fabms  as 
C51H72N4016. The 'H- and 13C-nmr data 

4  R=H 
5  R=Br 

that we recorded were virtually identical 
to spectral data reported for mycalolide C 
133, isolated  previously  from  a  sponge 
(12). 

The molecular formula of mycalolide 
D El7 was established as C5,H,,N40,,  by 
fabms and had uv (A  max 228 and 260 
nm) and  ir  (v max  3380,  1748,  1734, 
1700,1652 cm-')  absorptions appropri- 
ate for an oxazole-containing macrolide. 
The 'H- and 13C-nmr spectra of 1 (Table 
1) showed close correspondence to those 
reported for mycalolide C 137. Restricted 
rotation around the C-N bond of the N- 
methyl  formamide  resulted  in  doubled 
'H-  and  13C-nmr signals,  in  a  ratio  of 
approximately 2: 1, for those groups close 
to  the  unsaturated  formamide  moiety. 
This spectral feature, previously observed 
for the mycalolides (1 2), ulapualides (1 3), 
kabiramides  (14,15),  halichondramides 
(16,17), and jaspisamides (18), is charac- 
teristic of this class of macrolide. The 14

Hz coupling between H-34'  and H-35, 
and  nOe  interactions  between  the 
formamide  N-methyl  protons  (6 2.99) 
and  the  H-34 olefinic proton  (6 4.94), 
established  that  the  A34331 bond  had  E 
(trans) geometry. The C-5-C-6  and  C- 
1 9 4 - 2 0  double bonds could be assigned 
as E  based on the large vicinal couplings 
( J =  15.6 and 16.1 Hz, respectively) ob- 
served between the olefinic protons. The 
substitution of methoxy groups at C-22 
and  C-26  and  an  acetate  at  C-32  was 
confirmed by  HMBC  correlations.  The 
principal differences between the spectra 
of  1 and  3 were variations  in the C-30 
acyl groups and in the C - 8 4 - 1 2  region. 
Although  compound  3 is characterized 
by  a  2-O-methyllactate  group  at  C-30, 
compound  1 showed  'H-  {methyl  sin- 
gletsat63.37and3.46; 1Hmultipletsat 
6 3.60, 3.62, and 3.901 and  13C-nmr E6 
170.4,80.7,73.1,59.4,58.7]resonances 
appropriate  for  a  2,3-di-O-methylgly- 
cerate  substituent.  COSY  correlations 
supported this assignment and an HMBC 
correlation from the C-30 methine pro- 
ton (6 5.09) to C-36 (6 170.4) confirmed 
its  substitution  at  C-30.  Compound  1 
revealed  two  'H-nmr  singlets  (6 8.10, 
8.33) and  six 13C-nmr signals (6 130.1, 
136.6, 138.6, 143.2, 155.3,  162.7) in- 
dicative  of  two  adjacent  disubstituted 
oxazoles.  HMBC  correlations  required 
that one oxazole was conjugated to C-19, 
while the proton (6 8.33) of the second 
oxazole showed a three-bond correlation 
to  the  adjacent  C-12  (6  157.8) imide 
carbonyl group. The imide N H  (6 10.19) 
correlated with both the C-10 (6 173.5) 
and C-12 imide carbonyls, while correla- 
tions  from  the  C-9  methine  proton  (6 
3.05) and one of the C-8 methylene pro- 
tons (6 2 -67) to C- 10 confirmed the place- 
ment of the imide group. The presence of 
three contiguous oxazole rings is typical

was  intentionally  omitted  in  the  numbering 
scheme, as has been done for the imide derivative 
of halichondramide (16). 

of  this  class of  macrolide; however,  re- 
placement of the C- 10-C- 1 2  oxazole with 
an imide in mycalolide D 117 is reminis- 
cent of a Halichondria macrolide, which 
had an imide in place of the C- 16-C- 18 
oxazole (16). Substitution  of  a  methyl 
group at C-9, similar to the ulapualides 
(1 3), was confirmed by an HMBC corre- 
lation from the methyl protons to C-10. 
Thus, we were able to assign structure 1 
to mycalolide D. 

Mycalolide E 127, isolated as a minor 
constituent,  displayed  uv,  ir,  and  'H- 
nmr spectra similar to those of mycalolide 
C  131.  The  hrfabms  revealed  a  MH' 
pseudomolecular  ion  at  mlz  879.4434, 
which established the molecular formula 
as C46H62N1013. The structure Of  2 Was 
deduced primarily from 'H-nmr  studies 
and comparison of its spectral data with 
those of 3 and other related compounds 
in the literature. By COSY analysis and 
spectral comparison, the C-1 through C- 
8 portion of 2 was shown to be identical 
to that of 3. However, the C-9 methoxy 
substituent of 3 was replaced by a methyl 
group (6 1.3 1) in 2. Irradiation of the C- 
9 methyl signal induced strong nOe in- 
teractions  with  the C-8 methyl  and  H- 
11. Mycalolide E  127  is  the  first  com- 
pound  in this class to have methyl sub- 
stituents  at  both  C-8  and  C-9.  Three 
singlet aromatic  resonances characteris- 
tic  of  a  trisoxazole  constellation  were 
observed in 2. Again, the C-19-C-29 por- 
tion  of  2 was  shown by  direct  spectral 
comparison and COSY and nOe results to 
be identical to the corresponding regions 
in compounds 1 and 3. The lack of an acyl 
group  and  methine  proton  at  C-30, 
coupled with  deshielded signals for the 
C-29 methylene protons (6 2.48,2H, m) 
and theC-31 methineproton(62.75,m) 
indicated  a ketone at C-30. A C-30 ke- 
tone has been  observed in a majority  of 
the trisoxazole macrolides (1 2-1  8). Com- 
parative  analysis  indicated  that  C-3 1 
through  the  terminal  N-methyl  for- 
mamide group of 2 was clearly related 
to  that  section of  compounds  1 and  3,

with the exception of C-33. In 2, C-33 is 
an allylic methylene, while C-33 in both 
1 and  3  is  substituted  with  a  methyl 
group. The C-33 protons (8 2.46,2H, m) 
showed nOe interactions with H-35 and 
vicinal  couplings  to  the  C-32  methine 
proton and the C-34 olefinic proton. The 
spectral data we recorded for compound 2 
were  in  good  agreement  with  data  re- 
ported  for  C-33-demethylhalichondra- 
mides (1 6) and jaspisamides (18). While 
the structure ofmycalolide E 127 has been 
deduced  by  spectral analyses, confirma- 
tion using  heteronuclear correlation ex- 
periments  was  not  possible  due  to  the 
limited supply of the compound. 

Mycalolides C  13) and  D  111 were 
screened  against  the  NCI's  60-human- 
tumor cell line panel. They showed mod- 
est general cytotoxicity with average LC,, 
values of  2.5  p M  and  0.6  pM, respec- 
tively. They did not produce a pattern or 
a  degree  of  differential  cytotoxicity  of 
sufficient interest to encourage any fur- 
ther  study.  Mycalolide  E  E27 was  not 
tested due to insufficient material. 

Prior to this investigation, macrocy- 
clic lactones containing two or three con- 
tiguous oxazole rings have only been iso- 
lated  from  nudibranchs  and  their  egg 
masses (13-16),  and from sponges of the 
genera Halicbondria (1 6,17), Jaspis  (1 8), 
and Mycule( 12). Therefore, it was surpris- 
ing to find this class of  compound  in a 
coelenterate extract. Examination ofpho- 
tographs of the original T. faulkneri col- 
lection  and  voucher  specimens did  not 
reveal any obvious nudibranch or sponge 
tissue. Thus, it appears thedistributionof 
polyoxazole macrolides can be expanded 
to include corals in the genus Tubastrea.

ANIMAL m T E w . S a m p l e s   of  Tubastm 
fuulkkneri Wells were  collected along Salamander 
Reef at  Cape Cleveland, the  Great  Barrier Reef, 
northeast  Australia,  by  Dr.  Peter  Murphy  and 
colleagues of  the  Australian  Institute  of  Marine 
Science (AIMS). Voucher specimens (Q66C1269) 

from  this  collection  are  maintained  at  the 
Queensland Museum in Brisbane. 

EXTRACTION AND munoN.-Fmh 

samples 

were  frozen after collection and  stored  at  -20' 
until they were processed. Frozen samples (614 g) 
were  mixed  with  dry  ice,  ground  to  a  coarse 
powder, and then extracted with H,O.  The marc 
was  refrozen,  lyophilized,  and  sequentially  ex- 
tracted  with  MeOH-CH2C12 (1:l)  and  100% 
MeOH. The combined organic extracts were evapo- 
rated at reduced pressure togive 2.84g ofa brown 
tar. 

The total extract was  separated by a liquid- 
liquid  partitioning  protocol  (8) which  concen- 
trated the antitumor activity into CCI, and CHCI, 
fractions. The CCI,-soluble material (247 mg) was 
fractionated  by  gel  permeation  cc  on  Sephadex 
LH-20  eluting  with  hexane-CH,CI,-MeOH 
(2:5:1). Anearlyeluting LH-20 fraction(l30mg) 
retained the antitumor activity. This fraction was 
furtherpurified byhplconawide-porediolbonded- 
phase  column  (YMC,  1 x 2 0  cm,  300  A)  with 
hexane-CH2C1,-MeOH  (1 5:49: 1)  to  give 
mycalolides C [3] (14 mg) and D 11) (6 mg). The 
CHCI,-soluble  fraction  from  the  initial  liquid 
partitioning step was subjected to diol (YMC) vlc 
with a step-gradient elution. The cytotoxic mate- 
rial eluted with  100% CH,CI,  through  CH,CI,- 
MeOH  (97:3) was  separated by  diol  hplc  with 
hexane-CH2CI2-MeOH (15:49: 1) to yield indole- 
3-carboxaldehyde  (1  mg),  6-bromoindole-3- 
carboxaldehyde(2 mg),andamixtureofmacrolides 
that  were ultimately  purified by  C,,  hplc (1x25 
cm  column),  using  MeOH-H,O  (4:l) to  afford 
mycalolide E C2] (1 mg) and an additional 5 mg of 
3. Similar C,,  hplc purification of the vlc fraction
