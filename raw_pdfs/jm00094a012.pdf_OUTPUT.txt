A plyhalogenated acyclic monoterpene, 6(R)-bromo-3(S)-(bromomethyl)-7-methyl-2,3,%trichloro-l-octene (1) was 
obtained as a major component of the organic extract of  the red alga Portieria homemannu.  X-ray diffraction analysis 
provided the complete structure, including correct placement of  the different halogen atoms and determination 
of the absolute stereochemistry.  Detailed NMR analyses provided complete 'H and 
assignments.  Compound 
1 exhibited highly differential cytotoxicity against the U.S. National Cancer Institute's  new in vitro human tumor 
cell lime screening panel; brain tumor, renal, and colon tumor cell lines were most sensitive to 1, while leukemia 
and melanoma lines were relatively leas sensitive. A second collection of P. hmemanni yielded the novel, monocyclic 
2, considerably less cytotoxic and devoid of  differential  activity.  On the basis of  its unprecedented  cytotosicity 
Drofiie in the NCI primary  screen, compound  1 has been selected by the NCI Decision Network Committee for 
preclinical drug deielopment. 

Introduction 

Since the mid-1970s Rhodophyta (red algae) have been 
known to produce halogenated monoterpenes.'  Although 
scores of  acyclic, monocyclic, and  bicyclic halogenated 
monoterpenes have  been  identified:  this class of  com- 
pounds has been confined to the genera Plocamium and 
Chondrococcw.  The structure elucidation of  these com- 
pounds has not been a simple task. The relatively volatile 
monoterpenes tend to decompose under EI-MS conditions 
and acquisition of  molecular weight  and formula infor- 
mation has often been  difficult.  Correct placement of 
chlorine and bromine substituents has not proven to be 
straightforward, as NMR  chemical shift arguments are 
clouded by the cumulative effects of  multiple substituents 
on the Clo skeleton.  We  present here the X-ray crystal 
structure, absolute stereochemistry, complete lH and 13C 
NMR  assignments, and  novel  spectrum of  differential 
cytotoxicity  of  G(R)-brom0-3(S)-(bromomethyl)-7- 
methyl-2,3,7-trichloro-l-octene (11,  from  the  red  alga 
Portieria hornemannii. 

Silva (Chondrococcw hornemannii), which were initially 
selected for study on the basis of  the finding of  activity 
in  the  National  Cancer  Institute's  in  vitro  anti-HIV 
screening 
were partitioned  between CH2C12 and 
CH30H-H20 (1:19).  The antiviral CH2C12 solubles were 
permeated through  Sephadex LH-20.  The  seventh  of 
seven fractions was crystallized from methanol to give 1, 
which was inactive in the anti-HIV screen.  Preliminary 
'H  and  13C NMR  analyses  suggested  a  monoterpene. 
While ELMS failed to provide a discernible molecular ion 
or M - HX fragment ion, CI-MS did reveal a weak pseu- 
domolecular ion cluster beginning at m/z 416 (M + %+), 
which correaponded to the molecular formula C10H1&k2C1,; 
this  was  confirmed  by  high-resolution  EI-MS.  The 
structure was  solved by  X-ray  diffraction analysis (see 
Figure 1). To our knowledge, this is only the third X-ray 
crystal  structure  of  a  naturally  occurring  halogenated 
monoterpene.6p6 

A compound proposed to have the same structure as 1 
was reported  previously by Burreson et al.'  as an unre-

Although compound 1 did not exhibit any HIV-inhibi- 
tory activity, the anti-HIV activity of  the source extract 
was further tracked, via bioassay-guided chromatography 
and dereplication analysis, to traces of  aplysiatoxin and 
debromoaplysiatoxin, presumably derived from a cyano- 
bacterial contaminant or epiphyte in the algal collection.13 
Aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin have been previ- 
ously identified as the anti-HIV constituents of Lyngbya 
majuscula  in our 1ab0ratory.l~ 

A second collection of P. hornemannii was made from 
a different location, Central Visayas, in the Philippines. 
Analysis of  the organic extracts revealed the absence of 
1; instead, a new compound was isolated as the principal 
monoterpene in this collection.  The structure 2 was as- 
signed as a result of mass spectral (Cl0HI3Cl3 by HR-EI- 
242 nm, c  = 33401,  and NMR analyeea.  The 
MS), W (A- 
13C-NMR spectra disclosed, in addition to the four con- 
jugated sp2 carbons suggested by the W absorption, two 
methyls, a quaternary carbon, and three carbons bearing 
halogens (a methylene and two methines).  The coupling 
relationships were readily discerned from lH-'H  COSY 
experiments, and the assembly of  the various parts fol- 
lowed from the HMBC data. The relative stereochemistry 
was assigned from NOE experiments relationships of H-5 
to  H-4 and  H-6, H-4 to H-1, H-8 to H-2; the absolute 
configuration was not determined. 

Antitumor Screening Results and Discussion 

While 1 was inactive in the anti-HIV assay, it appeared 
quite highly cytotoxic against the uninfected human lym- 
phoblastoid control cells used in the AIDS-antiviral screen. 
This observation prompted us to evaluate 1 in the NCI's 
human tumor, disease-oriented in vitro screen.15-18  In-

temtingly, there was an exceedingly broad range of  in vitro 
sensitivities among the various types of human tumors to 
the cytotoxic effects of  1 (Figure 2; also see Experimental

Section).  For  example, compared  to  some  of  the  less 
sensitive melanoma and leukemia lines, several of the more 
sensitive brain, renal, and colon tumor cell lines were as 
much as 1000-fold or more sensitive to 1 at the GIM re- 
sponse level and 100-fold at the LCM level. 

Compound 2 showed little differential cytotoxicity in the 
NCI screening panel, and it was at least 1 order of mag- 
nitude lese potent at all three levels of  analysis (GIm, TGI, 
LCm) than  1 (Figure 2; also see Experimental Section). 
T w o  related compounds, 3 and 4, from the NCI Repository 
also  have  been  tested  as part  of  the  NCI's  empirical 
screening program.  The monocarbocyclic 4 gave a response 
similar to that of 2, showing some general cytoto.icity, but 
little differential among the various cell linee; the acyclic 

3010  Journal of  Medicinal Chemistry, 1992,  Vol. 35, No. 16 

3  was somewhat more potent than 4  but exhibited only 
very modest differential activity (data not shown). 

Other carbocyclic halomonoterpenes from Rhodophyta 
reportedly have shown general toxicity in brine shrimp 
and in vitro inhibition of  murine leukemia20 or 
other21 cell  lines, but  our  results  suggest further  that 
ceeain human solid tumor cell lines may be particularly 
smmptible to the cytotoxic effects of some members of this 
cless of compounds. The contrast between the acyclic and 
monocyclic compounds would suggest additionally that 
tbese compounds, particularly the acyclic ones, are not 
ssting  merely as  electrophiles (alkylating agents); con- 
sistent with this view were results of  computerized pat- 
tern-recognition studies, using the COMPARE algorith~ns,~'J~ 
which revealed no resemblance of  the mean graph profiles 
(not shown) of 1 to known alkylating agents.  Indeed, more 
extensive COMPARE pattern-recognition analyses likewise 
revealed  little  or  no  substantial  resemblance  of  the 
screening profile of  1 to that of any known mechanistic or 
structural cl.sss of  cytotoxic agent in the entire current (as 
of March 1,1992) database. 

Key  features  which  make  the  screening profile  of  1 
unique can be appreciated visually in the concentration- 
response curvcjs (Figure 2).  While a multilog spread in 
relative celluh sensitivities is not uncommon at the GIw 
(groarth inhibitory) level of  response, it is uncommon at 
the most demanding LCW (cytotoxic or net cell killing) 
Ievd of  rmponse.  Moreover, the clustering of the relatively 
more sensitive lines among the renal, brain, colon, and 
non-snall-cell  lung  cancer  subpanels,  along  with  the 
clustering of the relatively less sensitive lines among the 
leukemia and  melanoma  subpanels  (see Experimental 
Section), is a highly unusual combination.  A selection of 
those tumor cell lines showing the highest in vitro sensi- 
tivity to 1 will provide appropriate targets for detailed in 
vivo therapeutic investigations in appropriate xenograft 
models. 

Further biological activity comparisons of  1 with com- 
pounds not yet tested in the NCI screen but reported in 
the literature to have antitumor or cytotoxic properties in 
other screening systems are problematic at the present 
time.  Consistent or standardized reporting standards or 
formats for compounds tested in the new NCI screen need 
to be adopted by investigators more generally to facilitate 
such comparisons in  the future.  Herein, we  offer  two 
emmples of  complementary approaches to reporting com- 
parative biological data derived from the new NCI in vitro 
primary screen. 

Figure 2 exemplifies a composite which can be prepared 
directly from the laser-print graphical information typically 
included  in  the  standard  NCI  screening  data  report 
package provided to all submitters of  compounds to the 
NCI program.  Extraneous, repetitive, or otherwise dis- 
tmcting information has been removed and the graphical 
srsling simplified to allow considerable photoreduction yet 
still vividly  illustrate  the contrasting concentration-re- 
sgonse profiles. 

While the reporting of  screening results in simplified 
graphical formats may be very useful to illustrate, rein-

force, contrast, or compare certain unique, rare, or oth- 
erwise highly unusual  screening profiles such as those 
presented herein, we  do not suggest that such graphical 
reporting  necessarily  should  be  adopted  routinely  for 
publication. Just as NMR, mass spectrometric, and other 
routine, documentary spectral data are reported typically 
in  the chemical literature  in  a  cryptic, alphanumerical 
rather than graphical format, a similar approach may be 
more  efficient, and more acceptable to editors, for the 
routine  reporting  of  data  from  the  new  NCI  primary 
screen.  An example of  such an approach to an alphanu- 
merical format is given for compound 1 and 2 in the Ex- 
perimental Section.  The information provided is sufficient 
to allow the reader to reconstruct a "mean graph" profile 
which, in turn, could be used for comparisons, either vis- 
ually  or  by  computer, with  similarly reconstructed  or 
otherwise reported screening profiles of  known standards 
or other compounds of  interest in the future. 

In summary, we describe here the discovery of  a natu- 
rally-occurring pentahalogenated  monoterpene  which 
produces a highly novel cytotoxicity profile against the 
diverse tumor types which comprise the NCI's  primary 
screening panel.  We have presented the biological activity 
information in a variety of formats both to illustrate the 
unusual spectrum of  activity of  this particular compound 
and to offer some complementary data-reporting alterna- 
tives that hopefully may contribute to the evolution of 
consistent reporting standards for investigators using the 
new NCI screen. 

Compound 1 produces one of the most extreme exam- 
ples of  differential cytotoxicity observed thus far in the 
first 2 years of  operation of  the NCI screen.  The com- 
pound clearly is not a general cell poison; its preferential 
cytotoxicity to cell lines derived from highly chemoresis- 
tant  human  tumors  is  intriguing.  The  NCI  Decision 
Network Committee recently reached a similar consensus 
and selected compound  1 for drug development.22  An 
immediate NCI priority is mass recollection (now ongoing) 
of  P. homemannii from the original collection site, as well 
as the investigation of chemical synthesis as an alternate 
source of  the compound for preclinical development. 
Experimental Section 

Collection, Extraction, and Fractionation of P. Borne- 
mannii.  Our original sample of P. hornemannii was collected 
by  Ernani  G.  Menez  near  Chanaryan,  Batan  Island,  in  the 
Philippines in April 1986.  A voucher specimen is on deposit at 
the Smithsonian Institution.  The alga waa  frozen on collection, 
lyophilized, and extracted with CH2C12-MeOH (l:l), followed by 
a MeOH rinse.  The crude organic extract (2.5 g)  waa partitioned 
between CH2Cll (100 mL) and H2CkMeOH (191,100 mL). "he 
dichloromethane phase was reduced, in vacuo, and permeated 
through Sephadex LH-20 (column 2.5 X  150 cm) with CH2C12- 
MeOH  (1:l).  Seven fractions were obtained.

proximate dimensions 0.1  X  0.15  X  0.2  mm  was  selected for 
analysis. Preliminary X-ray photographs displayed orthorhombic 
symmetry. Accurate lattice constants of a = 6.115 (4) i$ b = 12.456 
(6) A,  c = 19.188 (10) A were determined from 30 diffractometer 
measured 28 values.  Systematic extinctions, optical activity, and 
crystal density were consistent with space group P212121, with one 
molecule of  composition C1a1,@r2C13 forming the asymmetric 
unit.  Additional crystallographic parameters were  V = 1461.6 
(14) A3, p(Mo Ka) 6.02  mm-',  and D, = 1.824 g cm-3 for 2 = 4. 
Intensity data were  collected  on  a  Nicolet (Siemens) P21 dif- 
fradometer with Mo Ka radiation (0.71073 A) and a 28-8 scan 
technique.  A total of  1157 Friedel unique data were collected, 
of which 686 (59%) with IF,I  1 4@,I  were considered observed 
after correction for Lorentz, polarization, and background effects. 
The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full 
matrix, least-squares techniques.=  The final refinements with 
anisotropic thermal parameters for all nonhydmgen atoms, riding 
isotropic hydrogens, and anomalous scattering corrections for 
bromine and chlorine converged smoothly to a final discrepancy 
index of  7.81%  for the enantiomer shown  (WR = 6.72%).  The 
other enantiomer converged to the significantly higher value of 
8.51%.  The absolute configuration also was ascertained by the 
9-test.  The enantiomer  shown  refined to 9 = +1.1 (2).23 A 
computer-generated perspective model of the f d  model is given 
in Figure 1; archival crystallographic data have been deposited 
with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, 
U.K. 

Second Collection of P. hornemannii and Isolation of 2. 
The subsequent collection of P. hornemunnii (2.7 kg fresh weight) 
was made at Banilad, Bacong, Central V i y a s ,  in the Philippines 
in April 1991, and kept frozen for transport and storage prior to 
extraction.  The frozen alga was ground with dry ice in a ham- 
burger grinder and extracted sequentially with MeOH-CH2C12 
(3:1, then 2 X  1:l). The extracts were filtered  and evaporated 
at 22  OC  to an aqueous suspension, which was extracted with 
CH2C12. The CHzC12 extracts were evaporated, again at 22  OC, 
to give 10.39 g of  a dark green oil.  A portion (1.7 g) of this extract 
was partitioned between CH30H-H20  (19:l) and hexane.  The 
hexane-soluble fraction (1.074 g) was permeated through Sephadex 
LH-20 (2.5 X  150 cm) with CH2C12-MeOH (1:l) to give seven 
fractions;  the  seventh  fraction  was  essentially  pure  1-[3-(1-
