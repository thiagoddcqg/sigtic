Received June 29, 2001

A novel triterpenoid saponin, pittoviridoside (1), which possesses an unusual 2,3,4-trisubstituted glycosidic
linkage, has been isolated from Pittosporum viridiflorum using the engineered yeast strains 1138, 1140,
1353, and Sc-7 for bioactivity-guided fractionation. The structure of this compound was determined to be
3-O-[(cid:226)-D-glucopyranosyl(1f2)]-[R-D-arabinopyranosyl(1f3)],[R-l-arabinofuranosyl(1f4)-(cid:226)-D-glucuronopy-
ranosyl-21-angeloyl-22-senecioylolean-12-en-3(cid:226),15R,16R,21(cid:226),22R,28-hexol by spectral, chemical, and GC
analyses. This compound showed weak cytotoxicity against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line.

176.7, 169.5, 168.3, 159.1, 143.6, 138.4, 129.5, 127.0, and
116.7. The chemical shifts of the carbonyl signals and the
absorption band at 1720 cm-1 in the IR spectrum indicated
the presence of two R,(cid:226)-unsaturated ester functionalities.
This interpretation was supported by an absorption maxi-
mum at 214 nm in the UV spectrum. In addition, the
presence of a carboxylic acid functionality was indicated
by a carbon signal at (cid:228) 176.7 in the 13C NMR spectrum
and an absorption maximum at 1720 cm-1 in the IR
spectrum. The negative FABMS of 1 exhibited a quasimo-
lecular ion peak at m/z 1271 [M-H]-. Other significant
fragmentation peaks visible at m/z 1139 [(M - H) - 132]-
and 1109 [(M - H)+ - 162]- corresponded to the loss of
one terminal hexose and one terminal pentose unit, re-
spectively.

In recent years we have been engaged in a program to
discover bioactive compounds using a mechanism-based
bioassay involving genetically engineered mutants of the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae2 along with cytotoxicity
against the A2780 human ovarian cancer cell line.3 As a
part of our continuing search for potential anticancer
agents, a sample of Pittosporum viridiflorum Sims (Pittospo-
raceae) collected in Madagascar as part of the plant
collection program of the National Cancer Institute was
subjected to testing, and its methanol extract was found
to exhibit weak cytotoxicity to the A2780 human ovarian
cancer cell line as well as activity in the yeast assay.

A number of investigators have examined extracts of the
leaves of Pittosporum species, including P. viridiflorum, for
their antimicrobial effects;4,5 this is apparently due to a
number of volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes.6-8 Mollus-
cicidal activity was also described.9 A number of saponin
aglycons isolated from P. viridiflorum have also been
reported.10 Herein we report the structure and bioactivity
of a novel triterpenoid saponin, designated as pittovirido-
side (1).

The MeOH extract of P. viridiflorum was subjected to
solvent partitioning followed by C18 vacuum flash chroma-
tography of the bioactive aqueous MeOH fraction, with the
fractionation being guided by the results of A2780 cyto-
toxicity and yeast assays. The chromatographic fraction
eluted from the C18 column with 70% and 80% aqueous
MeOH was bioactive (IC12 120, 150, 150, 140 (cid:237)g/mL against
the 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7 yeast strains) and was
purified by repeated reversed-phase HPLC and Si gel
preparative TLC to give the new saponin pittoviridoside
(1).

Compound 1 was obtained as an amorphous white
powder that was determined to have the composition
C62H96O27 by HRFABMS and 13C NMR analyses. The IR
spectrum showed absorptions at 3400 (OH) and 1720
(CdO of COOH and R(cid:226)-unsaturated ester) cm-1. The 13C
NMR spectra of this compound showed signals character-
istic of three carbonyl groups and three double bonds at (cid:228)

Hydrolysis of 1 with 3 N HCl under reflux for 4 h
afforded the aglycon, named pittoviridagenin (2), which
showed a simplified NMR spectrum. A molecular formula
of C40H62O8 was deduced for 2 by a combination of HR-
FABMS and 13C NMR spectrometry. The presence of six
carbon signals ((cid:228) 78.9, 78.0, 73.0, 72.5, 67.6, and 62.8) in
the 13C NMR spectrum indicated this compound to contain
a number of oxygen-based functionalities. This interpreta-

tion was supported by the 1H NMR spectrum, in which
seven downfield signals were observed at (cid:228) 6.65 (1H, d, J
) 10.2 Hz), 6.25 (1H, d, J ) 10.2 Hz), 4.35 (1H, dd, J )
4.2, 4.2 Hz), 4.20 (1H, dd, J ) 9.4, 4.2 Hz), 3.73 (1H, dd, J
) 9.8, 4.6 Hz), 3.48 (1H, m), and 3.43 (1H, dd, J ) 9.8, 4.6
Hz). Two of the seven oxygenated proton signals at (cid:228) 3.73
and 3.43 were confirmed to be due to oxymethylene protons
by DEPT and HMQC experiments. In addition, a careful
examination of the 1H and 13C NMR and IR spectra
revealed that another two oxygenated protons ((cid:228) 6.65 and
6.25) were present as esters of angelic and senecic acids.
The overall structure of 2 was determined by a combina-
tion of 1H COSY, TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC experiments
and by comparison of NMR spectral data with literature
data.11 The relative positions of the angeloyl and senecioyl
groups were confirmed by long-range correlations of H-21
and H-22 with quaternary carbonyl carbons; H-21 cor-
¢ of the angeloyl group at (cid:228) 169.0 and H-22
related with C-1¢
with C-1¢ of the senecioyl group at (cid:228) 166.7, respectively.
Thus, the structure of pittoviridagenin was unambiguous-
ly determined as 21-angeloyl-22-senecioylolean-12-en-
3(cid:226),15R,16R,21(cid:226),22R,28-hexol, or 21-angeloyl-22-senecioyl-
R1-barrigenol (2).

In the 1H NMR spectrum of pittoviridoside (1), signals
for four anomeric protons at (cid:228) 5.18 (1H, br s), 5.00 (1H, d,
J ) 7.8 Hz), 4.91 (1H, d, J ) 7.4 Hz), and 4.46 (1H, d, J )
7.8 Hz) were correlated with signals for four carbons at (cid:228)
108.2, 102.9, 104.1, and 105.7 by an HMQC experiment
and were diagnostic for the presence of four sugar residues.
The chemical shift of C-3 at (cid:228) 91.9 indicated that the four
sugars were attached to C-3 of the aglycon. The identifica-
tion of each sugar unit as well as their linkages was
established by chemical degradation, TLC and GC analy-
ses, and extensive NMR experiments.

Acid hydrolysis of 1 followed by TLC analysis of the
hydrolysate and direct comparison with standard sugars
indicated the presence of glucose, arabinose, and glucuronic
acid, and these results were confirmed by GC-MS analysis
of the methyl acetates and comparison to standards. The
absolute configurations of the hydrolyzed pentoses were
determined by GC-MS analysis of their thiazolidine
derivatives prepared with l-cysteine methyl ester hydro-
chloride
followed by peracetylation, as previously
reported.2g,12

, H-3¢

, C-3¢

, and C-4¢

Most of the protons and carbons of each sugar unit were
assigned on the basis of extensive NMR 1H-1H COSY,
TOCSY, and HMQC experiments. The assignment of the
signals of C-2¢
in the glucuronic acid
moiety was difficult because the signals of H-2¢
, and
H-4¢
¢ were overlapped almost completely in the 1H NMR
these signals were thus assigned by an
spectrum;
HMQC-COSY experiment. The cyclic structures of the
monosaccharides were also determined to be D-glucu-
ronopyranose, D-glucopyranose, L-arabinopyranose, and
D-arabinofuranose (or alternatively D-arabinopyranose and
L-arabinofuranose) by 1D TOCSY and HMBC data. A
combination of the HMBC and 1D and 2D NOESY experi-
ments and mass spectral data of sugar derivatives estab-
lished the arrangement of these sugar residues. A long-
¢ with C-3 revealed a linkage
range correlation of H-1¢
between C-1¢
¢ of the glucuronic acid and C-3 of the aglycon.
This interpretation was confirmed by a strong NOESY
cross-peak between H-3 and H-1¢
¢ and also between H-23
and H-1¢
. Similarly, a long-range correlation between
¢ assigned the linkage between glucuronic
H-1¢
acid and glucose with the additional confirmation of
NOESY correlations between H-24 and protons of H-5¢

and C-2¢

) with C-3¢

and H-6¢
. The linkage between the glucuronic acid and
the arabinopyranose was defined by an HMBC correlation
of the anomeric proton of the arabinopyranose at (cid:228) 4.91
(H-1¢
of the glucuronic acid at (cid:228) 80.2. The
linkage between the arabinofuranose and the glucuronic
acid was assigned by an HMBC correlation between the
anomeric proton of the arabinofuranose at (cid:228) 5.18 (H-1¢
)
and C-4¢

¢ at (cid:228) 75.1.

Further evidence for the nature of the sugar linkages
was derived from analysis of the MS fragmentation of the
sugars after methylation, reduction, hydrolysis, reduction,
acetylation, and GC separation (Scheme 1, Supporting
Information).13 The monosaccharides D-glucuronopyranose,
D-glucopyranose, and D-arabinopyranose were confirmed to
have (cid:226)-, (cid:226)-, and R-linkages respectively by measurement
of the coupling constants of their anomeric protons, while
the R-configuration of L-arabinofuranose was clarified by
observation of NOESY correlations between the C-1, C-3,
and C-5 protons of this sugar.

¢ and H-1¢

The remaining problem was to distinguish between the
two possibilities of L-arabinopyranose/D-arabinofuranose
and D-arabinopyranose/L-arabinofurnaose for the arabinose
units; this assignment was made by interpretation of
NOESY data. Correlations between H-3¢
and
between H-4¢
and H-1¢
could be assigned unambigu-
ously since the attachment point of each sugar was
established by HMBC experiments and other key protons
of arabinoses were not involved in the region around (cid:228) 3.86,
where H-3¢
of glucuronic acid were almost
completely overlapped. A strong NOE was also observed
between H-2¢
of the
arabinofuranose. Therefore, the absolute configurations of
arabinopyranose and arabinofuranose must be defined as
D and L, respectively. If these configurations were ex-
changed, a NOESY cross peak would not have been found
of arabinopyranose and H-4¢
between H-2¢
of arabino-
furanose.

of the arabinopyranose and H-4¢

and H-4¢

The structure of pittoviridoside (1) was thus identified
unequivocally as 3-O-[(cid:226)-D-glucopyranosyl(1f2)]-[R-D-ara-
binopyranosyl(1f3)]-[R-L-arabinofuranosyl(1f4)-(cid:226)-D-glu-
curonopyranosyl-21-angeloyl-22-senecioyl-R1-barrigenol. Al-
though several saponins containing R1-barrigenol and
glucuronic acid have been isolated from various phy-
tochemical sources,9,14 1 has two unusual structural fea-
tures compared with previous isolates. In the first place,
it has both D-arabinopyranose and L-arabinofuranose in the
sugar portion of the molecule. The coexistence of ara-
binopyranose and arabinofuranose with the same absolute
configuration has been reported only rarely,15 although
different compounds isolated from the same plant having
arabinose units with the opposite absolute configurations
have also been reported.16 To the best of our knowledge,
however, this is the first example of a nonpolymeric
compound simultaneously having the same sugar unit with
opposite absolute stereochemistries and different ring sizes.
A second unusual feature is the presence of a consecutively
1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted glycosidic linkage in the glucuronic
acid part. This kind of functionality appears to have been
reported only once previously.15b

Pittoviridoside 1 showed weak activity (IC12 85, 80, 140,
and 100 (cid:237)g/mL) against the 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7
strains in our yeast bioassay; IC12 is the concentration
required to inhibit the growth of a microorganism in a 12
mm diameter zone. In a cytotoxicity test using the A2780
human ovarian cancer cell line it also exhibited weak
cytotoxicity (IC50 10.1 (cid:237)g/mL).

Experimental Section

General Experimental Procedures. Optical rotations
were taken on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter. UV spectra
were measured on a Shimadzu UV1201 spectrophotometer. IR
spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1600 instru-
ment. NMR spectra were recorded in CD3OD on a JEOL
Eclipse+ 500 instrument at 500.1624 for 1H and 125.8 MHz
for 13C, and Varian Unity 400 NMR instrument at 399.95 MHz
for 1H and 100.58 MHz for 13C NMR, using standard pulse
sequence programs. Mass spectral data were obtained at the
Nebraska Center for Mass Spectrometry and on a VG 7070EHF
mass spectrometer in the Department of Biochemistry, Vir-
ginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Plant Material. The plant was collected in April 1993 by
staff from the Missouri Botanical Garden in Antsiranana
Province in the Ankarana Reserve of Madagascar. Pittosporum
viridiflorum is an undergrowth tree, and the sample was from
a branch. The collection number was NCI # Q66V2626, MBG
# 1726; the sample used was one of four parts of the plant
that were collected. The plant was identified by Roy Gereau
at Missouri Botanical Garden.

Yeast Bioassay. The Sc-72a and 1138/1140/13532c yeast

bioassays were carried out as previously described.

Cytotoxicity Bioassay. The A2780 cytotoxicity assay was
performed at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Uni-
versity as previously reported.3

Extraction and Isolation. The plant samples were dried,
ground, and extracted with MeOH to give the dried methanolic
extract N056221. The bioactive MeOH extract (2.71 g) de-
scribed was active against the mutant 1138, 1140, 1353, and
Sc7. The MeOH extract (IC12 650, 700, 800, 1150 (cid:237)g/mL in
the 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7 yeast strains) was dissolved in
80% aqueous MeOH (250 mL) and extracted with n-hexane
(300 mL (cid:2) 2). The bioactive aqueous MeOH layer was diluted
with H2O to 60% aqueous MeOH and then partitioned with
CH2Cl2 (300 mL (cid:2) 2). The activity was retained in the 60%
aqueous MeOH, which was fractionated between n-BuOH and
H2O to afford 1.62 g of n-BuOH-soluble bioactive extract (IC12
500, 530, 640, 570 (cid:237)g/mL in the 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7
yeast strains). Half of the n-BuOH fraction was subjected to
C18 vacuum flash chromatography using gradient mixtures of
MeOH and H2O (elution order: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90% aqueous
MeOH, MeOH). The active fractions (0.420 g) eluted with 70%
and 80% aqueous MeOH were combined (IC12 120, 150, 150,
140 (cid:237)g/mL in the 1138, 1140, 1353, and Sc7 yeast strains) and
separated by semipreparative reversed-phase HPLC (YMC
ODS-A column, 1 cm (cid:2) 25 cm, 37% aqueous MeOH, 230 nm).
Final purification was done by Si gel preparative TLC with
the solvent of the upper layer of n-BuOH-EtOH-H2O (5:1:4)
to give 13 mg of pittoviridoside (1).

neutralized with 5% Na2CO3 and extracted with EtOAc three
times to afford an aqueous layer and organic layer containing
the sugars and the aglycon, respectively. Preparative TLC of
the aglycon from the organic layer on Si gel (CHCl3-MeOH,
1:9) gave 1.5 mg of pittoviridagenin (2).

Sugar Analysis by TLC and GC-MS. The sugar compo-
nents of the aqueous layer left after hydrolysis were analyzed
by Si gel TLC, the solvent system used being CHCl3-MeOH-
H2O (32:18:4, v/v). Spots were visualized by spraying with 95%
EtOH-H2SO4-anisaldehyde (9:0.5:0.5, v/v) and heating at 120
°C for 10 min. The results were confirmed by GC-MS analysis
of methyl sugar peracetates. The aqueous layer was evapo-
rated, dissolved in 10% HCl-dry MeOH (2 mL), and heated
under reflux for 4 h. After removing the solvent under reduced
pressure, the residue was treated with excess acetic anhydride
and pyridine. Removal of the solvent by blowing with nitrogen
gave the methyl sugar peracetates, which were analyzed by
GC-MS and compared with authentic methyl sugar acetate
standards. The GC-MS runs were performed using a 30 m (cid:2)
0.32 mm i.d. HP-5 column with an initial temperature of 75
°C for 1 min and then temperature programming to 250 °C at
a rate of 10 °C/min.

Linkage Analysis. The analysis was carried out as previ-

ously described.2g

Stereochemical Determination of Pentoses. The de-
termination of the absolute configuration of the pentoses was
performed by Hara’s method12 as previously described.2g
Pittoviridoside (1 mg) was placed in 0.25 mL of MeOH and
0.5 mL of 1 N HCl. This was heated at 100 °C overnight. Water
and CHCl3 were added, the mixture was shaken, and the
water-soluble fraction was dried by rotary evaporation. This
fraction was placed in 0.3 mL of pyridine, and 3 mg of cysteine
methyl ester hydrochloride was added; this was heated for 2
h at 100 °C. Acetic anhydride (0.3 mL) was then added and
allowed to react for a further 2 h. The sample was cooled and
solvent removed by blowing off with argon to yield a mixture
of thiazolidine-carboxylate derivatives, which was analyzed by
GC-MS using a 30 m (cid:2) 0.32 mm i.d. HP-5 capillary column
connected to the VG7070EHF mass spectrometer. The injector
temperature was 200 °C, and a temperature of 75 °C for 1 min
and then a gradient to 250 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min was
used. Individual peaks for the thiazolidine derivatives of
L-arabinose (26.24 min) and D-arabinose (24.41 min) were
observed.
